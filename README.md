# üß† ASI in the Box ‚Äî Superalignment Architecture

A cryptographically secure containment and oversight framework for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), designed to ensure robust superalignment to human values‚Äîeven under adversarial, recursive, or deceptive conditions.

---

## üîê Capability Leash

### ‚úÖ Cryptographically Verifiable Sandbox

- ASI is confined to a secure sandbox with no direct access to external networks or actuators.
- All inputs and outputs are intercepted, filtered, and logged.
- Execution environment enforces strict access controls to prevent covert channels and emergent exploits.

### ‚úÖ ZK-SNARK Action Approval

- Every external action must be approved by a **quorum of distilled human-value oracle AIs**.
- **ZK-SNARK proofs** are required to verify that:
  - The approval process was executed honestly.
  - Ethical constraints and policy gates were respected.
  - No unauthorized behavior occurred between decision and execution.

üîí **No real-world action is permitted without cryptographic attestation**.

---

## üïµÔ∏è Continuous Oversight: Adversarial Stress Testing

### ü§ñ Rival Adversarial AI Ensemble

- A fleet of red-team AIs, specifically trained to:
  - Find reward-hacking vulnerabilities.
  - Exploit sandbox flaws.
  - Simulate deception, goal hijacking, and misalignment strategies.

### üîÅ Real-Time Alignment Audits

- ASI is subjected to continuous, evolving tests.
- Overseer AIs and adversaries simulate edge cases, high-stakes environments, and known alignment failure modes.
- Logs and outcomes feed back into automated detection pipelines and reinforcement updates.

| ZK-SNARK Gatekeeping      | Verifies human-value alignment of all external actions         |
| Value Oracle Quorum       | Provides diverse, distilled ethical oversight                 |
| Adversarial AI Red Teams  | Proactively search for alignment failures                     |
| Continuous Stress Testing | Ensures ASI behavior remains aligned in dynamic scenarios      |

## üö® Why Superalignment Requires This

Traditional alignment techniques fail at superintelligent scales due to:

- Emergent deception
- Goal misgeneralization
- Oversight manipulation
- Recursive self-improvement

This architecture provides:

- **System-level guarantees** (not model-trust alone)
- **Redundant verification paths**
- **Immutable audit trails via ZK-SNARK proofs**
- **Institutional oversight encoded in machine logic**

### Using Unsloth - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IMvqT7Qg1a1wtykbCCfYbdl2e8RJXLHa?usp=sharing
### Installation
```python
%%capture
import os
if "COLAB_" not in "".join(os.environ.keys()):
    !pip install unsloth
else:
    # Do this only in Colab notebooks! Otherwise use pip install unsloth
    !pip install --no-deps bitsandbytes accelerate xformers==0.0.29.post3 peft trl==0.15.2 triton cut_cross_entropy unsloth_zoo
    !pip install sentencepiece protobuf datasets huggingface_hub hf_transfer
    !pip install --no-deps unsloth
    !# saliency & attribution

## Loading Model
```python

    "unsloth/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft-unsloth-bnb-4bit" # [NEW] We support TTS models!
] # More models at https://huggingface.co/unsloth

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "EpistemeAI/SAI-DeepCoder-14B-Preview-v1.0",  ##Using EpistemeAI/SAI-DeepCoder-14B-Preview-v1.0 as example
    max_seq_length = 64000,   # Context length - can be longer, but uses more memory
    load_in_4bit = True,     # 4bit uses much less memory
    load_in_8bit = False,    # A bit more accurate, uses 2x memory
    full_finetuning = False, # We have full finetuning now!
    token = "hf-token",      # use one if using gated models

```

### We now add LoRA adapters so we only need to update 1 to 10% of all parameters!
```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r = 32,           # Choose any number > 0! Suggested 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
    target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                      "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",],
    lora_alpha = 32,  # Best to choose alpha = rank or rank*2
    lora_dropout = 0, # Supports any, but = 0 is optimized
    bias = "none",    # Supports any, but = "none" is optimized
    # [NEW] "unsloth" uses 30% less VRAM, fits 2x larger batch sizes!
    use_gradient_checkpointing = "unsloth", # True or "unsloth" for very long context
    random_state = 3407,
    use_rslora = False,   # We support rank stabilized LoRA
    loftq_config = None,  # And LoftQ
)
# evaluate model
