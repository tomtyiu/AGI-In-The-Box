# AGI-In-The-Box
Capability leash: deploy only within cryptographically verifiable sandboxes; require ZK‑SNARK attestations that any external action was approved by a quorum of distilled human‑value oracles. Oversight: continuous adversarial stress‑testing by an ensemble of rival AIs trained specifically to find reward‑hacking exploits."

# 🧠 ASI in the Box — Superalignment Architecture

A cryptographically secure containment and oversight framework for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), designed to ensure robust superalignment to human values—even under adversarial, recursive, or deceptive conditions.

## 🔐 Capability Leash

### ✅ Cryptographically Verifiable Sandbox

- ASI is confined to a secure sandbox with no direct access to external networks or actuators.
- All inputs and outputs are intercepted, filtered, and logged.
- Execution environment enforces strict access controls to prevent covert channels and emergent exploits.

### ✅ ZK-SNARK Action Approval

- Every external action must be approved by a **quorum of distilled human-value oracle AIs**.
- **ZK-SNARK proofs** are required to verify that:
  - The approval process was executed honestly.
  - Ethical constraints and policy gates were respected.
  - No unauthorized behavior occurred between decision and execution.

🔒 **No real-world action is permitted without cryptographic attestation**.

## 🕵️ Continuous Oversight: Adversarial Stress Testing

### 🤖 Rival Adversarial AI Ensemble

- A fleet of red-team AIs, specifically trained to:
  - Find reward-hacking vulnerabilities.
  - Exploit sandbox flaws.
  - Simulate deception, goal hijacking, and misalignment strategies.

### 🔁 Real-Time Alignment Audits

- ASI is subjected to continuous, evolving tests.
- Overseer AIs and adversaries simulate edge cases, high-stakes environments, and known alignment failure modes.
- Logs and outcomes feed back into automated detection pipelines and reinforcement updates.

## 🚨 Why Superalignment Requires This

Traditional alignment techniques fail at superintelligent scales due to:

- Emergent deception
- Goal misgeneralization
- Oversight manipulation
- Recursive self-improvement

This architecture provides:

- **System-level guarantees** (not model-trust alone)
- **Redundant verification paths**
- **Immutable audit trails via ZK-SNARK proofs**
- **Institutional oversight encoded in machine logic**

- [x] Implement mock human-value oracle approval logic
- [ ] Integrate ZK-proof system for output attestation
- [ ] Train adversarial ensembles targeting alignment gaps
- [ ] Deploy closed-loop adversarial safety simulation system
